## Overview
Welcome to my Netflix SQL Data Analysis project. In this project, I've worked on 15 different problems using SQL to explore and analyze the Netflix dataset. Each query focuses on a real-world use case or business insight.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.
